# Solid Migrator: Linkrot Mitigation: Internet Archive

The most all-encompassing solution today has to be the [internet archive](https://archive.org/) and the wayback machine. It aims to keep track of all information on the internet, and allow you to timetravel to earlier versions of any URL. This is a staggering amount of work and data. But it is a single organization and the lifework of a single individual, Brewster Kahle. I have no doubt the work of the internet archive will continue after Brewster Kahle retires. But it is a big risk to bet the history of the entire web on a single organization.

## Other archives

The Internet Archive isn't the only archive out there, but it is the most well-known and longest running. Other archives are:

- (//archive.today)
- (//perma.cc) [looked at seperately here](perma.md)
- (//timetravel.mementoweb.org/)

## Pro's

- Original Datapod Server may be offline or serving other unrelated content
- Good trackrecord of availability

## Con's

- Single organization, so it isn't a decentralized solution
- There is no good way to induce it to take a snapshot
- Only works on complete files / datasets
